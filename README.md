# Apple Health Importer

A simple app to import Apple Health Data in XML format to new iPhone devices and Xcode simulators.

## Features

- Import Apple Health Data in XML format to any new iPhone device
- Use Apple Health Data in Xcode simulators for iOS app development
- Quickly transfer health data between devices or to testing environments

## How It Works

Apple Health Importer allows you to:

1. Export health data from an existing iPhone as an XML file
2. Import the XML file into a new iPhone or Xcode simulator
3. Use the imported data for testing and development purposes

## Development

This app was created to streamline the process of using real Apple Health Data in iOS app development and testing. It's particularly useful for:

- Testing health-related features in iOS apps
- Simulating various health data scenarios
- Ensuring app compatibility with different health data sets

## Known Issue
- Apple Sleep Analysis is not working properly. The sleep phases do not import as they should. This is currently not limiting for my used case but in case you need to work with sleep data then this code is not working properly and needs to be fixed.
